# IAM Policy Library

Getting IAM Policies just right is a pain in the butt and the prebuilt AWS policies can be overly permissive for many use-cases. This is a collection of vetted policies for common real-world scenarios.

## ðŸ¤¬ Hate IAM Policies and looking for something better?

You're not alone! We made [AppPack](https://apppack.io?utm_source=iam-policy-library) because working with AWS is challenging and you've got other things to worry about. AppPack makes deploying web apps to AWS dead simple and focuses on a great developer experience for your team.
